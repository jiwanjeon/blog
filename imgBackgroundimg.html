        <h2>HTML img Tag vs CSS background-image Property</h2>
        <h3>HTML img Tag</h3>
         <p class="quote">When it is not just a design element, but also a part of the content, such as a diagram, logo, or a person.</p>
         <p class="quote">When you expect that people will print your page and want the image to be included by default.</p>
         <p class="quote">When you want to be indexed by the search engine. Google doesn’t index background images automatically. Browsers don’t provide any information on background images to assistive technology. But using the <img> tag with the alt and title attributes will help to be recognised by screen readers.</p><br>
         <p class="quote">When the image has an essential semantic meaning (e.g., a warning icon). The use of an img tag will ensure that the meaning can be communicated in all user agents.</p>
         <p class="quote">When you want to improve animation performance over a background</p>

        <h3>CSS background-image Property</h3>
          <p class="quote">If the image is only used for design</p>
          <p class="quote">If the image isn't part of the content</p>
          <p class="quote">If you expect that people print your page, and don't want the image to be included by default.</p>
          <p class="quote">If you want to imporve the download time(as with CSS sprites)</p>
          <p class="quote">If you need to stretch the background image to fill its whole window. Use with the background-img size set to "cover"</p>
          <p class="quote">If there is a need to repeat images</p>
