        <h2>What is JavaScript Hoisting?</h2>
          
 <p>
    <p class="quote">Variable declaritons are scanned and are made undefined.</p>
    <p class="quote">Function declarations are scanned and are made available. It means that it allow us to use a function before we declare it in our code.</p>
    <p class="quote">JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</p><br>

  <p>
    <xmp>
      getName();
      console.log(x);

      var x = 7;

      function getName() {
        console.log("Namaste JavaScript");
      }
    </xmp>
When we run this code, we will get "Namaste JavaScript" and "Undefined"<br>However, if we run this code<br>
    <xmp>
      getName();
      console.log(x);

      function getName() {
        console.log("Namaste JavaScript");
      }    
    </xmp>
We will get "Namaste JavaScript" and "Not defined". This is how the hoisting work in JavaScript.<br>I will treat the difference between Undefined and not defined later.

  </p>
  
   <br><br>
   <h2>So, what is the main advantage of hoisitng?</h2><br> 1. We don't have to worry about order of use and declaration.<br><br> 2. Not to be forced to place the inner-most functions at the top of the script block, and the outer-most functions at the bottom.
